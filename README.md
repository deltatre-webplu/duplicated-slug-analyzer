# Duplicated Slug Analyzer

This is a simple console app to get a feedback about duplicated slug inside your system.

## Configuration

There are 3 mandatory configurations (**if you don't provide these settings the application will exit doing nothing**) 
 - guishellBaseUrl: the base URL of your Guishell installation
 - applicationName: the name of Forge application registered under Guishell
 - guishellSecret: the secret to be used to call Guishell admin API
 
You can also specify the following optional configurations:
- reportDirectoryPath: the absolute path under which you want to save the JSON file containing the report produced by the application. If not specified the report will be saved under the folder *Reports* located at the same level of the executable file
- logsDirectoryPath: the absolute path under which you want to save the application logs. If not specified the logs will be saved under the folder **Logs** located at the same level of the executable file

You can configure the application by using JSON configuration file, environment variables and command line arguments.  

Following rules hold true for the available configuration modes:
- environment variables override JSON configuration file
- command line arguments override environment variables
- JSON configuration file must be called *appsettings.json* and must be placed at the same level of the executable file
- **any configuration mode you decide to use the settings must be named as indicated above**
